Advanced GPS System
This project involves the development of an advanced GPS navigation system that offers multiple features for improved travel experience. The system is designed to:

Determine the Shortest Travel Path: Using optimized algorithms, it calculates the most efficient route based on distance or travel time.
Provide Information on Amenities: It identifies nearby amenities such as hotels, restaurants, petrol pumps, and other points of interest along the route.
User-Defined Connections: Users can input new routes or connections, allowing the system to dynamically adjust the navigation.
Real-Time Travel Time Estimation: The system offers real-time estimates for travel time, adjusting dynamically to account for traffic conditions, weather, and other factors.
This project integrates mapping APIs, route optimization algorithms, and real-time data to create a powerful and user-friendly GPS system.
